            <l1>There are 171 species of chameleons.</l1>
            <l1>Changing skin color is an important part of communication among chameleons.</l1>
            <l1>Chameleons live in Madagascar, Africa, Spain, Portugal and Asia in rain forests, savannas, semi-deserts and steppes.</l1>

            <l1>Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.</l1>
            <l1>Pigeons have excellent hearing abilities. They can detect sounds at far lower frequencies than humans are able to, and can thus hear distant storms and volcanoes.</l1>
            <l1>Pigeons can fly at altitudes up to and beyond 6000 feet, and at an average speed of 77.6 mph. The fastest recorded speed is 92.5 mph.</l1>

<p>
    <ol>
        <l1> The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting trip.</l1>
        <l1>Inspired by a cartoon featuring the event, shopkeeper Morris Michtom and his wife Rose made a stuffed bear with a sign ‘Teddy’s bear’ and left it in their shop window.</l1>
        <l1> It gained so much attention that they started a successful toy making company.</l1>

    <p>
        <ol>
            <l1>The giant panda's distinct black-and-white markings have two functions: camouflage and communication.  Most of the panda - its face, neck, belly, rump - is white to help it hide in snowy habitats. The arms and legs are black, helping it to hide in shade. </l1>
            <l1>At 5 months old, giant pandas learn how to climb</l1>
            <l1>Pandas need at least 2 different bamboo species in their range to avoid starvation</l1>
